# Locomotion Control

This section of the repository focuses on locomotion control in robotics. Locomotion control involves the study and application of methods to manage and regulate robotic movement. It encompasses both classical control techniques and modern approaches that integrate machine learning algorithms.

Within this folder, you will also find a subfolder on [Reinforcement Learning](./reinforcement-learning/), which addresses the application of reinforcement learning methods to locomotion control.
